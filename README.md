Explanation: 
The tragedy of the commons is a dilemma described in an influential article titled “the tragedy of the commons” written by ecologist Garret Hardin and published in 1968 (Hardin 1968). The Dilemma is caused by actors, who share a common good but act rationally according to each self interest. Thus, they behave contrary to the best interests of the whole community which leads to depletion of the good (resource). 

Research question:
Amongst other factors, research on reputation in social dilemmas has shown, that it can improve the likelihood of cooperation and thus preventing recources from depletion (Milinski et al. 2002). Furthermore, from a sociological perspective, it is highly unrealistic to assume like the original model, that there is no interaction between the actors (individuals, groups or states) outside of the game. We build upon work of Milinski et al. (2002) by extending the main game by alternating rounds of a second game. We therefore replicate their approach but try to focus on the reputational effect. Contrary to Milinski et al.'s approach, we do not change the sequence of the experiment as a treatment. We isolate the effect of the reputation by introducing a control group where the players do not know the history of other player's decision. We expect that this group will be more likely to run into a tragedy than the other group, where the individuals are interested in maintaining their individual reputation.

Research design:
  Hard facts:
    Two groups, A (with treatment) and B.
    Treatment: history of decisions (players get a nickname to identify them)
    Game: public goods game and indirect reciprocity game, will be played alternatley (1st round PGG, 2nd round IRG, 3rd PGG, 4th IRG,       and so on)
    Number of rounds: 6-7 (maybe for each game, maybe for all games - no decision has yet been made)
    Number of players: 6
    Time for each round: 20 seconds

The players will be randomly divided in two groups. Group A get the treatment where we display the history of decisions that will be made in the past for each player at each round. Group B did not get a displayed history. The groups get informed by the instruction if their decisions are public or not. Both groups will be played alternatley a public goods game and an indirect reciprocity game.
A public goods game will be played at the first round. Here they have the chance to cooperate (take a certain low amount out of a common pool) or not to cooperate (take a higher amount out of the common pool). The amount of tokens will be stored in their private accounts. The ammount for cooperate/non-cooperate is equal at each PGG round and defined by us. After that round the history will be displayed for Group A. 
In the second round the players will be play the indirect reciprocity game. At this game the players will be randomly assigned among themselves and have to make the decision how much tokens (from their private account) they trade to the faced (by nickname) player. Moreover, the player who trade receives a payment by another, different player. For example: A trade to B, B trade to C, C trade to A - or reverse - A receives from C, B receives from A and C receives from B. So the trade/receive are indirect reciprocal.
At the next round of PGG the common pool will be refilled at each PGG round (until the end or the group is bankrupt) by the factor if all players cooperate, e.g. is the cooperate amount 5 tokens then the pool will be refilled with 30 tokens (5 tokens multiplied with 6 players).
After these rounds the games will be played alternatly with a refilling pool for the PGG.
If a group goes bankrupt they continue only with the IRG until the end. Hence, the players did not get the chance to gain their private account by the common pool (tragedy), they can just switch tokens among themselves.

# Further notes
Quick idea for indirect reciprocity game: Do players use their own coins to give away or keep or do they get coins to give away or take? -> Prospect Theory (Kahnemann 1979)

From Stefano:
Implementing only history as treatment, without indirect reciprocity: Stefano would expect that only revealing the other players' decisions would lead not to less, but more extraction from the common pool! Because "fair" players would feel encouraged to also be uncooperative?! Are we convinced? Stefano suggests we should test this
