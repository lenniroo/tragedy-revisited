Explanation: 
The tragedy of the commons is a dilemma described in an influential article titled “the tragedy of the commons” written by ecologist Garret Hardin and published in 1968 (Hardin 1968). The Dilemma is caused by actors, who share a common good but act rationally according to each self interest. Thus, they behave contrary to the best interests of the whole community which leads to depletion of the good (resource). 

Research question:
Amongst other factors, research on reputation in social dilemmas has shown, that it can improve the likelihood of cooperation and thus preventing recources from depletion (Milinski et al. 2002). Furthermore, from a sociological perspective, it is highly unrealistic to assume like the original model, that there is no interaction between the actors (individuals, groups or states) outside of the game. We build upon work of Milinski et al. (2002) by extending the main game by alternating rounds of a second game. We therefore replicate their approach but try to focus on the reputational effect. Contrary to Milinski et al.'s approach, we do not change the sequence of the experiment as a treatment. We isolate the effect of the reputation by introducing a control group where the players do not know the history of other player's decision. We expect that this group will be more likely to run into a tragedy than the other group, where the individuals are interested in maintaining their individual reputation.

Research design:
Two groups, A and B.

Group A: 


Group B:
