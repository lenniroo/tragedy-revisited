# Collaborators: Alexander Herbel, Lennart Rösemeier, Leo Röhlke


Explanation: 
The tragedy of the commons is a dilemma described in an influential article titled “the tragedy of the commons” written by ecologist Garret Hardin and published in 1968 (Hardin 1968). The Dilemma is caused by actors, who share a common good but act rationally according to each self interest. Thus, they behave contrary to the best interests of the whole community which leads to depletion of the good (resource). 

Research question:
Amongst other factors, research on reputation in social dilemmas has shown, that it can improve the likelihood of cooperation and thus preventing recources from depletion (Milinski et al. 2002).
